TO DO:

fix x and o elements so they fit within containers at smaller screen sizes
  this may be easier said than done. there's a thing called fittext.js for download
  but i can also imagine taking a screenshot of the full size image and then instead
  of the squares filling up with text ('x' or 'o') it would fill up with the image of x or o
  I'm sure I could get the image to shrink and expand responsively, and it would blend in perfectly
  with the background. Of course if I changed the background-color of the squares or something I'd
  have to take new screenshots for the images to match. So I definitely shouldn't delete the text code I have!
